## What is Azure Synapse Analytics

The technological research and consulting firm Gartner defines four common types of analytical technique that organizations commonly use:

 - **Descriptive analytics**, which answers the question “**What is happening** in my business?”. The data to answer this question is typically answered through the creation of a data warehouse in which historical data is persisted in relational tables for multidimensional modeling and reporting.

 - **Diagnostic analytics**, which deals with answering the question “**Why is it happening?**”. This may involve exploring information that already exists in a data warehouse, but typically involves a wider search of your data estate to find more data to support this type of analysis.

 - **Predictive analytics**, which enables you to answer the question “**What is likely to happen** in the future based on previous trends and patterns?”

 - **Prescriptive analytics**, which **enables autonomous decision making** based on real-time or near real-time analysis of data, using predictive analytics.

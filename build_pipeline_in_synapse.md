# Build a data pipeline in Azure Synapse Analytics

**Pipelines are the lifeblood** of a data analytics solution. Learn how to use Azure Synapse Analytics pipelines to build integrated data solutions that extract, transform, and load data across diverse systems.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will learn how to:

 - Describe core concepts for Azure Synapse Analytics pipelines.
 - Create a pipeline in Azure Synapse Studio.
 - Implement a data flow activity in a pipeline.
 - Initiate and monitor pipeline runs.

## Introduction

With the wide range of data stores available in Azure, **there's the need to manage and orchestrate the movement data** between them. In fact, **you'll usually want to automate extract, transform, and load (ETL) workloads as a regular process** in a wider enterprise analytical solution. *Pipelines are a mechanism for defining and orchestrating data movement activities*. In this module, you'll be introduced to Azure Synapse Analytics pipelines, their component parts, and how to implement and run a pipeline in Azure Synapse Studio.

 Note: Azure Synapse Analytics pipelines are built on the same technology as Azure Data Factory, and offer a similar authoring experience. The authoring processes described in this module are also applicable to Azure Data Factory. For a detailed discussion of the differences between Azure Synapse Analytics pipelines and Azure Data Factory, see [Data integration in Azure Synapse Analytics versus Azure Data Factory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/data-integration/concepts-data-factory-differences).

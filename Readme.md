 - Big data
 - Lakehouse architecture

As an Azure data engineer, you also help to ensure that the operationalization of data pipelines and data stores are high-performing, efficient, organized, and reliable, given a set of business requirements and constraints. You help to identify and troubleshoot operational and data quality issues. You also design, implement, monitor, and optimize data platforms to meet the data pipelines.

As a candidate for this certification, you must have solid knowledge of data processing languages, including:

 - SQL
 - Python
 - Scala

You need to understand parallel processing and data architecture patterns. You should be proficient in using the following to create data processing solutions:

 - Azure Data Factory
 - Azure Synapse Analytics
 - Azure Stream Analytics
 - Azure Event Hubs
 - Azure Data Lake Storage
 - Azure Databricks

### Skills measured

 - Design and implement data storage

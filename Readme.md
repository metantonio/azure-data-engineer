# Microsoft Certified: Azure Data Engineer Associate

Demonstrate understanding of common data engineering tasks to implement and manage data engineering workloads on Microsoft Azure, using a number of Azure services.

Last course update: **11/02/2023**

## Overview

You should have subject matter expertise in integrating, transforming, and consolidating data from various structured, unstructured, and streaming data systems into a suitable schema for building analytics solutions.

As an Azure data engineer, you help stakeholders understand the data through exploration, and build and maintain secure and compliant data processing pipelines by using different tools and techniques. You use various Azure data services and frameworks to store and produce cleansed and enhanced datasets for analysis. This data store can be designed with different architecture patterns based on business requirements, including:

 - Modern data warehouse (MDW)
 - Big data
 - Lakehouse architecture

As an Azure data engineer, you also help to ensure that the operationalization of data pipelines and data stores are high-performing, efficient, organized, and reliable, given a set of business requirements and constraints. You help to identify and troubleshoot operational and data quality issues. You also design, implement, monitor, and optimize data platforms to meet the data pipelines.

As a candidate for this certification, you must have solid knowledge of data processing languages, including:

 - SQL
 - Python
 - Scala

You need to understand parallel processing and data architecture patterns. You should be proficient in using the following to create data processing solutions:

 - Azure Data Factory
 - Azure Synapse Analytics
 - Azure Stream Analytics
 - Azure Event Hubs
 - Azure Data Lake Storage
 - Azure Databricks

### Skills measured

 - Design and implement data storage
 - Develop data processing
 - Secure, monitor, and optimize data storage and data processing

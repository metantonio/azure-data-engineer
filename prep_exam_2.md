# Advanced questions

1. Describe the process of implementing a custom partitioning strategy in a dedicated SQL pool in Azure Synapse.

Answer: 

 - Identify the partition key: Choose a column that has a high cardinality and is frequently used in queries.
 - Create a partition scheme: Define how the data will be distributed across the partitions.
 - Create a partition function: Define the range or list values that will partition the table.
 - Create the table with the partition scheme and function:

```sql
CREATE PARTITION FUNCTION MyPartitionFunction (int)
AS RANGE LEFT FOR VALUES (1000, 2000, 3000);

CREATE PARTITION SCHEME MyPartitionScheme
AS PARTITION MyPartitionFunction TO ([PRIMARY], [PRIMARY], [PRIMARY], [PRIMARY]);

CREATE TABLE MyPartitionedTable
(
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Data NVARCHAR(50)
)
ON MyPartitionScheme(ID);

```

Explanation: Custom partitioning allows for optimized query performance by distributing data based on specific criteria. This approach requires careful planning and understanding of the data distribution and query patterns.

2. How would you optimize the performance of a large-scale data ingestion pipeline in Azure Synapse using Spark Pools?

Answer:

 - Optimize file formats: Use optimized file formats like Parquet or ORC for better compression and faster read/write operations.
 - Parallelize data ingestion: Leverage Sparkâ€™s distributed computing capabilities to parallelize data ingestion.
 - Partition data: Partition data appropriately to improve read performance.
 - Optimize Spark configurations: Tune Spark configurations such as executor memory, number of cores, and shuffle partitions.
 - Use caching: Cache intermediate data frames to speed up iterative operations.
 - Optimize data transformations: Use efficient transformations and avoid wide transformations when possible.

3. Explain how you would implement a data lakehouse architecture using Azure Synapse and Delta Lake.

Answer:

 - Set up Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS): Store raw and processed data.
 - Ingest data using Azure Synapse Pipelines: Use pipelines to ingest data from various sources into ADLS.
 - Create Delta Lake tables: Use Spark Pools in Azure Synapse to create Delta Lake tables for reliable and performant data storage.

```scala
import io.delta.tables._

val deltaTable = DeltaTable.createOrReplace(spark)
    .tableName("delta_table")
    .addColumn("id", "INT")
    .addColumn("value", "STRING")
    .location("adl://path/to/delta_table")
    .execute()

```

 - Implement data transformations: Use Spark to transform data and save the results back to Delta Lake.
 - Query data using SQL Pools: Create external tables in SQL Pools to query Delta Lake tables.

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE DeltaTable
(
    ID INT,
    Value STRING
)
WITH (
    LOCATION = 'adl://path/to/delta_table',
    DATA_SOURCE = DeltaLakeDataSource,
    FILE_FORMAT = DeltaLakeFileFormat
)

```

 - Ensure data consistency: Use Delta Lake's ACID transactions to ensure data consistency and reliability.

Explanation: A data lakehouse combines the best features of data lakes and data warehouses, providing reliable, performant, and scalable data storage and query capabilities. Using Delta Lake in Azure Synapse allows for ACID transactions, schema enforcement, and efficient data processing.

4. How can you implement real-time data processing in Azure Synapse using Azure Stream Analytics and Spark Pools?

Answer:

 - Set up Azure Event Hubs: Configure Event Hubs to receive real-time data streams.
 - Create an Azure Stream Analytics job: Define input from Event Hubs, query for real-time processing, and output to Azure Synapse.

```sql
SELECT
    System.Timestamp AS EventTime,
    deviceId,
    AVG(temperature) AS AvgTemperature
INTO
    SynapseOutput
FROM
    EventHubInput
GROUP BY
    TumblingWindow(minute, 5),
    deviceId;
```

 - Configure Spark Pools: Set up a Spark Pool in Azure Synapse for further data processing.
 - Ingest data into Spark Pools: Use Spark to process real-time data ingested by Azure Stream Analytics.

```scala
val eventHubDF = spark.readStream
    .format("eventhubs")
    .option("eventhubs.connectionString", "<EventHubConnectionString>")
    .load()

val processedDF = eventHubDF
    .withColumn("timestamp", current_timestamp())
    .groupBy(window(col("timestamp"), "5 minutes"), col("deviceId"))
    .agg(avg("temperature").alias("AvgTemperature"))

processedDF.writeStream
    .outputMode("append")
    .format("delta")
    .option("checkpointLocation", "adl://path/to/checkpoint")
    .start("adl://path/to/delta_table")

```

Explanation: Real-time data processing in Azure Synapse involves using Azure Stream Analytics to process and analyze data streams from Event Hubs, and then using Spark Pools for further real-time processing and storage in Delta Lake.

5. Describe a strategy to handle slowly changing dimensions (SCD) Type 2 in Azure Synapse.

Answer:

 - Create a staging table: Load the incoming data into a staging table.
 - Identify changes: Compare the staging table with the existing dimension table to identify new and changed records.
 - Insert new records: Insert new records into the dimension table.
 - Update existing records: For changed records, update the existing records by setting the current flag to 0 and end date to the current date.
 - Insert changed records as new rows: Insert the changed records as new rows with the current flag set to 1 and the start date as the current date.

```sql
-- Step 1: Load data into staging table
INSERT INTO StagingTable
SELECT * FROM SourceTable;

-- Step 2: Identify changes and insert new records
INSERT INTO DimensionTable (ID, Attribute, StartDate, EndDate, CurrentFlag)
SELECT s.ID, s.Attribute, GETDATE(), NULL, 1
FROM StagingTable s
LEFT JOIN DimensionTable d ON s.ID = d.ID
WHERE d.ID IS NULL;

-- Step 3: Update existing records
UPDATE DimensionTable
SET EndDate = GETDATE(), CurrentFlag = 0
FROM DimensionTable d
INNER JOIN StagingTable s ON d.ID = s.ID
WHERE d.Attribute <> s.Attribute AND d.CurrentFlag = 1;

-- Step 4: Insert changed records as new rows
INSERT INTO DimensionTable (ID, Attribute, StartDate, EndDate, CurrentFlag)
SELECT s.ID, s.Attribute, GETDATE(), NULL, 1
FROM StagingTable s
INNER JOIN DimensionTable d ON s.ID = d.ID
WHERE d.Attribute <> s.Attribute AND d.CurrentFlag = 1;

```

Explanation: Handling SCD Type 2 requires managing historical data by maintaining multiple versions of records. This strategy involves inserting new records, updating existing records to mark them as inactive, and inserting new versions of changed records.

6. Write a SQL query to implement a window function to calculate a rolling average of sales over the last 3 months in Azure Synapse.

```sql
SELECT
    SalesDate,
    ProductID,
    SalesAmount,
    AVG(SalesAmount) OVER (
        PARTITION BY ProductID
        ORDER BY SalesDate
        ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) AS RollingAvgSales
FROM Sales;

```

Explanation: The window function AVG calculates the rolling average of SalesAmount over the last 3 months for each product, partitioned by ProductID and ordered by SalesDate.

7. Write a SQL query to perform a full outer join between two tables and handle null values in Azure Synapse.

```sql
SELECT
    COALESCE(a.ID, b.ID) AS ID,
    a.Value AS ValueA,
    b.Value AS ValueB
FROM
    TableA a
FULL OUTER JOIN
    TableB b
ON
    a.ID = b.ID;

```

Explanation: The FULL OUTER JOIN returns all records when there is a match in either TableA or TableB. The COALESCE function handles null values by returning the first non-null value in the specified list.

8. Write a SQL query to implement a common table expression (CTE) to calculate hierarchical data in Azure Synapse.

```sql
WITH EmployeeHierarchy AS (
    SELECT EmployeeID, ManagerID, EmployeeName, 0 AS Level
    FROM Employees
    WHERE ManagerID IS NULL
    UNION ALL
    SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.ManagerID, e.EmployeeName, eh.Level + 1
    FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN EmployeeHierarchy eh ON e.ManagerID = eh.EmployeeID
)
SELECT * FROM EmployeeHierarchy;
```
Explanation: The CTE EmployeeHierarchy recursively calculates the hierarchical level of employees, starting with top-level managers (where ManagerID is null) and iteratively joining employees to their managers.

9. Write a SQL query to implement a merge operation to synchronize two tables in Azure Synapse.

```sql
MERGE INTO TargetTable AS target
USING SourceTable AS source
ON target.ID = source.ID
WHEN MATCHED THEN
    UPDATE SET target.Value = source.Value
WHEN NOT MATCHED BY TARGET THEN
    INSERT (ID, Value) VALUES (source.ID, source.Value)
WHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE THEN
    DELETE;

```

Explanation: The ``MERGE`` statement synchronizes the TargetTable with the SourceTable by updating existing records, inserting new records, and deleting records that do not exist in the source table.

10. Write a SQL query to use the PIVOT operator to transform rows into columns in Azure Synapse.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT ProductID, SalesDate, SalesAmount
    FROM Sales
) AS SourceTable
PIVOT (
    SUM(SalesAmount)
    FOR SalesDate IN ([2024-01-01], [2024-02-01], [2024-03-01])
) AS PivotTable;

```

Explanation: The ``PIVOT`` operator transforms rows of SalesDate into columns, aggregating SalesAmount for each ProductID by SalesDate. This is useful for creating cross-tabulations and summarizing data.
